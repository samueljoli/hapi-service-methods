# hapi-service-methods

A functional alternative to [schmervice](https://github.com/hapipal/schmervice).

## Inspiration

Services are a great way to group related businesss logic. [Schmervice](https://github.com/hapipal/schmervice) is a
service layer designed to integrate nicely with [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi), is class based, and was developed and is maintained by the amazing
folks responsible for [hapipal](https://github.com/hapipal). This library was built to be the functional alternative. 
If you perfer or don't mind Classes then I'd recommend you use [schmervice](https://github.com/hapipal/schmervice).
